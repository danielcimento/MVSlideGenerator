Shunned and alone in the twilight,
showered in sorrow in this hazy spring.
A jaded town, without any hospitality whatsoever.
My nose drips with loneliness, and I laugh foolishly.
This tiresome mudslinging contest isn't funny anymore.
Violently competing for the love of a girl wearing crimson hairclips.
I'd like to feel the velvet corner of your eye and your slightly cold smile.
Because you're a fla-fla-fla-flamingo.
A vibrant fla-fla-fla-flamingo, when you dance.
Wandering away, smiling, never to return.
All you've left is this loneliness and envy.
Well, thanks for stopping by. Make sure to treat the next one better.
I'm so grateful to have been graced by your presence.
I'm recklessly ecstatic, without a care in the world.
Putting on a false front, humming to myself.
In truth I'm confused, impulsive, and exposed as a simpleton.
I just want to listen to that precious voice of yours,
like I'm a crook, extorting some easily earned quick cash.
And it's fine by me if you're the only one shining on this good-for-nothing stage.
Because you're a fla-fla-fla-flamingo.
A breath-taking, bashful fla-fla-fla-flamingo.
Floating lightly away, as if it this were goodbye.
But it's not. Let's try to talk this out.
For Christ's sake, don't take back the things you've already said!
Pelted by hail, snivelling, holding a cat-teaser in my right hand.
But these days that's not enough to lure you back in.
I'll spend eternity wandering in this ravine.
Oh, Prince of Hell, just look at that girl and see for yourself.
A story of a paper-maiche drunkard. A monkey show 'til the day I die.
But you're a fla-fla-fla-flamingo.
A vibrant fla-fla-fla-flamingo, when you dance.
Wandering away, smiling, never to return.
All you've left behind is envy.
Well, thanks for stopping by. Make sure to treat the next one better.
Shunned and alone in the twilight of this hazy spring.
Laughing foolishly in this jaded, inhospitable town.
